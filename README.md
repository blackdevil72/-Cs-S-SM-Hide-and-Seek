SM: Hide and Seek

What's this?
--------------------------------
Terrorists "Hiders" choose a random model on spawn, like a chair, plant or a sign, which is common on the played map and search a place, where they blend in best. The CTs "Seekers" wait a specified time to give the hiders a chance to find their spot. They have to search for the hiders and shoot them.

Seekers either lose some health (default 5 hp) on every shot or hiders get more invisible everytime they get shot - or both. Seekers gain hp by hurting or killing a hider.
